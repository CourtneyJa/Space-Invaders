# Space-Invaders
A tribute to classic space ship shooter games made with Python and Pygame. I made this for fun, to learn something new by trying out Pygame, as well as make my first game. 

How To Play
 - Click your mouse to start the game
 - Hit the space bar to shoot
 - Moving your ship:
    - Press (a) to move left
    - Press (d) to move right
    - Press (w) to move up
    - Press (s) to move down
    - You can press multiple to move diagonal
 - Each ship that successfully passes you will decrease your lifes
 - Standard rules apply - get hit by laser and lose health; collide and lose health

Potential Add-ons
 
I'd like to add scoring and the ability to earn more lives by reaching a certain points earned threshold.
